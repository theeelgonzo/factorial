# factorial
a function for solving factorials for a given number.

I got caught up on an online course for Python writing a code for factorials.
I'm pretty positive I would be better writing it in JS.
I am going to do my darnedest to prove that here.
At the very least, here we will have a long-form function for solving factorials for given numbers.
